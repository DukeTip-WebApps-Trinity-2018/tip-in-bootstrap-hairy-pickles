          <strong>What We've Accomplished So Far</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>At the beginning, we were all very new to each other. Most of us were strangers and had only seen each other for
          a few hours. Introductions were given, and once we had gotten mostly used to eachother we began to start our curriculum.
          The first day we started off easy, getting used to the computers and setting up our programs. We learned some basic
          HTML and learned what to do and what not to do, helping us set a foundation for the weeks to come. The second day,
          we finished up the basic HTML and moved on to basic CSS, which we used for styling the websites we had been creating.
          After we set a foundation by learning about basic CSS, we implemented Bootstrap and used that instead of spending
          hours in CSS in order to shorten our workload and our code, making it not only easier to read but also to write.
          The third day, we completed our first Bootstrap website from scratch and compared to the model, and we are now
          working modifying it to our liking and to describe our experience in DukeTIP thusfar.</p>

          <strong>Aman's DukeTIP Experience</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>My DukeTIP experience has been interesting. I came here expecting to see nerds who had nothing to do over the summer.
          But after being here for even a short amount of time, I have realized that there are a variety of people here.
          My favorite part of DukeTIP so far has probably been my Web Applications and Development course. Not only because
          of the awesome TA's we have, but also because it has helped me in so many ways. Before coming to DukeTIP I was
          learning Python from Codecademy, but honestly wasn't learning anything. I was just rote memorizing things so I
          could say that I have learned python. But after being in this class for less than a week, I can strongly say that
          I have learned the basics of CSS and HTML very well. All in all, DukeTIP has really taught me two things. #1) Never
          judge a book by it's cover. #2) Always push yourself and learn as much as you can from every experience you have.</p>

          <strong>Our Experience</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>The DukeTIP program has opened our eyes to new experiences and such. The activities are what we expected and some
          more but they are still fun. The teachers are way better here than at our school's as we don't have to listen to
          women's rights and other stuff from a class that has nothing to do with that. The people here are actually smart
          and are nothing like the people at our schools; there are less males in the world because the Titanic right? Nyet,
          that's why we like the classes here better than the regular schools. Some of us have many friends that were unable
          to make it to the camp, but that makes us find new friends. There is a greater variety of ethnicities and skills
          than our regular lives and that makes for a more interesting experience.</p>

          <strong>Food</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>The most important part of life, obviously. Surprisingly, the food is pretty good! The staff here at Trinity are
          kind and are always willing to serve you, and with all the ingredients being fresh and mostly locally sourced,
          you can be sure that you'll be getting food that'll be good for you and your taste buds.</p>
        <h4>
          <strong>Dorm Life</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>One of the most exciting factors of DukeTIP is that it allows you to live in a dorm just like a college student!
          A new experience for most people, it offers one of the greatest and most important skills needed for a student
          to be able to support themselves. The experience seems pretty accurate to actual college life, and seems like something
          any student would enjoy.</p>
        </h4>
        <h4>
          <strong>Social Life</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>
          I'm sure
          <strong>EVERYONE</strong> can agree that it was a relief when we heard there was no homework for DukeTIP, and that after
          classes end we would attend free times, evening studies, and group events. The evening events, no matter how boring
          they may sound, are all actually fun, thanks to our amazing RC's that help make everything a new and fun experience
          to be had.
